Terminus aims to be full of hot takes and awful analysis, just like R41R. We want to bring the Internet our brand of snark and humor and talk with some Atlanta sports news along the way. This time, your illustrious host Akshay will be talking about the latest in Atlanta United and USMNT news. Take a listen:

# Show Notes

### Orlando City vs Atlanta United, round 2

Last week, we saw a [1–0 win in Orlando](https://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2017-07-21-orlando-city-sc-vs-atlanta-united-fc/details/video/111313) for the Five Stripes with a rocket from Hector Villalba and clutch saves from Brad Guzan. [Can they do it again this Saturday](https://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2017-07-29-atlanta-united-fc-vs-orlando-city-sc/preview)?

[OCSC acquired Dom Dwyer for $1.6 million this week](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/07/25/dom-dwyer-traded-orlando-city-sc-record-deal). How does that change things on Saturday? [Michael Parkhurst notes that Kaká is more dangerous playing on the left](http://www.myajc.com/sports/atlanta-united-curious-about-kaka-orlando-city/SbmOConicpsUYGhuvZkMFJ/), rather than in the central position he floated into last week. Additionally, [SKC has evolved to win without Dwyer](http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mls/sporting-kc/article164187732.html), so this trade could actually work out for both teams instead of being the [Herschel Walker-level failure](http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=thegreattraderobbery) I thought it was when I first heard about it.

Injury Updates: [Martinez out again with a foot contusion](http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-united-martinez-out-orlando-city/cQoxVYV4J7IlRArMzWlvtI/), but[ Jacob Peterson is back](http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-united-peterson-glad-back/2VkXuryvSX2LQnLk6p0gDP/)!

**Stadium Update**: [Mercedes-Benz Stadium’s roof will be closed for the bulk of the Falcons’ season as it gets automated](http://www.ajc.com/sports/leadoff-roof-closes-field-turns-green-mercedes-benz-stadium/wKWU5A7aRdrUmgjNcBi2EN/). That means no open-roof ATLUTD games until the late fall. My take: a whole lot of :/. At least [it looks beautiful](http://atlantaunited.blog.ajc.com/2017/07/25/behold-mercedes-benz-stadium/) and turf is starting to come in!

[Goodbye, Bobby Dodd!](https://www.dirtysouthsoccer.com/2017/7/27/15951872/bobby-dodd-has-been-more-than-a-temporary-home-for-atlanta-united) (well, I’ll see you regularly again in September but still…)

### MLS All-Star Game

[Garza, Almirón, and Parkhurst made the roster ](https://www.mlssoccer.com/all-star/2017/rosters/mls-all-star-team)— what can we expect to see from Chicago Fire/MLS All-Star head coach Velko Paunovic on [August 2](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/07/28/mls-all-stars-vs-real-madrid-2017-mls-all-star-game-preview)?

Hold on, Velko picked Parkhurst for his squad? HOW?

[Columbus Crew SC F Justin Meram commented on how the All-Star Game is more of a celebrity game than a true showcase of the league’s best players](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/07/22/after-scoring-ninth-goal-season-justin-meram-laughs-all-star-snub). Thoughts?

### USMNT

[GOLD CUP CHAMPS! WOOOOOOOO](https://twitter.com/ussoccer/status/890417310279770112)

Roster predictions for next summer?

[Atlanta as a host city in joint North American World Cup bid for 2026?](http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-contacted-about-2026-world-cup/6roaFBA4uZDgbh5SOuYWNN/)
