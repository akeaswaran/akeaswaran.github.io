## Summary

On Thursday, January 25, Georgia Tech's CREATE-X organization hosted athletic director Todd Stansbury and assistant athletic director of innovation Doug Allvine as part of a discussion on innovation and entrepreneurship at the intersection of sports and technology.

AD Stansbury began by discussing his work with student-athlete startups during his tenure at Oregon State, pointing out two major projects in particular: a social media marketing consultancy oriented towards small businesses without the capital to build their own online brands and a digital media firm built around exposing fans to the athlete experience. Stansbury went on to take questions from both the CREATE-X moderator and the crowd about Georgia Tech's investment in sports-tech and how Tech will help shape the future of the industry.

Stansbury made some of his most poignant comments in the back half of his session, discussing a variety of topics concerning Tech athletics' application of analytics in its internal processes and its adoption of modern sports-tech.

### On the 'Atlanta United' effect and lessons in ticket sales:
Stansbury noted that working with Atlanta United and hosting soccer matches at Bobby Dodd Stadium made GT staff aware that “(t)here’s a sports fan out there that’s totally different than the ones...we typically try to sell to”. There's a younger population out there that takes MARTA to Midtown bars instead of driving to a Tech parking lot and tailgating for four hours before a game in a spot that they've hung out with family, friends, and neighbors in for upwards of 20 years. GTAA now has the challenge of connecting with that demographic, some of whom may never have heard about Tech before, and bringing them into our arenas for games. Stansbury goes on to emphasize that Tech has to *sell* tickets: when people talk about the big-names in college athletics - the Alabamas, the Ohio States, the Michigans - "you don't have to sell them a ticket, they just tell you when tickets are available". Tech has to work to create relationships with fans around Atlanta (and around the country), battling existing college affiliations and four successful pro teams for attention in a crowded media market. The task of selling tickets is further confounded by the dispersion of Tech's alumni; it's easy to get an alumnus that lives in the Southeast to a Tech game, but what about ones that live in, say, South Dakota? It's harder to convince them to buy season tickets because it's just not worth it to them because of the distance from campus. That's why, Stansbury mentions, "we're trying to move from transactional (ticket sales) to relationship (building)". To do so, Tech has partnered with local startup Experience to create a sort-of "Ramblin' Wreck pass" - a membership program for donors that helps them choose how they engage with GTAA in a manner that's best suited for them.

### On student discontent with the new basketball student ticket system:
> “It ends up being a messaging problem - if there’s a seat available, then you can still get in”
> “It’s (in place) so that for a big game, you’re not standing in line two days before the game and camping out”
> “The initial reaction is that (tickets) wasn’t really a problem to begin with, but now it’s out there and a problem (just with our messaging)”

### On analytics usage in concessions pricing and fan experience in GT arenas:

> “Everything that we do is being analyzed...we have a 3rd party in Sodexo and sometimes that complicates matters, but that’s not gonna stop us from analyzing things…”

> “Because we’re in a pro town, things are a little different for us...since we have (pro teams around) and are in the oldest on-campus stadium, we have to make the most of what we have”

* one size doesn’t fit all and we have to design experiences for diff people

> “How do we create in the stadium other experiences so that there are more options on what we offer?”


### On Tech's brand awareness and non-revenue sports:
* football drives economic engine, most ADs get revenue from it (75-90%) - basketball produces a lot at big name schools but not always, sometimes a third sport has revenue (hockey, baseball) - looking at football and basketball to maximize revenue but other sports have opps to maximize other things (health/wearable/perf/etc)

> “You can’t be on TV like we’re on TV and not be good...whether we’re making money or not, that influences your brand”

> "I look at the Stanford brand...my hypothesis is that (athletes always look to Stanford) because they’re good at everything...I feel like we should have the same brand...there’s no reason Georgia Tech athletics shouldn’t be one of those schools that student athletes (always look at)”

- Teams gotta be good to support the brand

> maximizing revenue from non-rev: “it ends up being a ROI problem....what can we do the move the needle.. you know, winning changes things. ”

- OSU’s nonrev teams won titles and increased revenue, importance in analyzing what sports in which you can move the needle

### On adding more Division 1 sports:
> “we will at some point be adding sports just because of the changing demographics at the Institute...we will in the next decade (look at adding new sports)...and women’s soccer will be at the top of the list....we’ll also look at lacrosse and beach volleyball...but soccer’s looking like the top pick”


### On technology influencing winning:
> “how can our 3*s compete against 5*s three years down the road?”
> “make sure that our kids in their 3rd/4th years have developed enough to compete versus those...phenoms”
> “being able to spot talent and analyze talent can be a great equalizer”
> “we can’t be lazy...we have to be smarter about how we do things”

- training/recruiting tech helps neutralize advantages other schools have

### On getting students into sports analytics and tech:
> “well we do use a lot of student labor....now that we have a masters in analytics, we’re talking to students there” and getting them access to our data

> “to help solve real life problems we’re having….(getting them) personal contacts within the department...athletics has a history of using student help in every area of the department”

### On the ethics of using athletes' health data and cultural issues surrounding analytics:
> “there’s a lot of concern...if we know all this stuff how will it be used?....one of the student athlete reps from the ACC at the end of the (NCAA) convention said...how is some of this data gonna be used? We can know when our student athletes are asleep...when they are supposed to be in class...there is some concern at the student-athlete level over how this is gonna be used”

- gonna vet uses before using them

> “NFL is way down the road in accumulating all kinds of data, but they’re purposely not using it because they don’t know what the unintended consequences will be”

- they have chips and video everywhere but they don’t want that data available everywhere bc that affects drafting and opinions
- walking very slowly to avoid opening Pandora’s box

> “we’re accumulating data so much faster than we can absorb it...you don’t have an analytics department who can crunch on this data and teach coaches how to use it”

> “we have 8 different systems that our coaches are using but the time they get the data practice is over...the next step is how do you make this (data) actionable?”

### On competing with other universities in tech:
> “Doug has done an innovation audit of Atlanta...every pro team (in Atlanta) wants to...engaged in innovation”, and they want us to be the hub for it.

* Faculty research presentations to pro teams and Adidas last month.

> “We are surrounded (by innovation in Atlanta)”, and if we can take advantage of it then we’ll really be set

### On the partnership with Adidas:
> “they want to bring manufacturing closer to the markets...we believe we can play a role in (Adidas’s plan to change how sports apparel is made in the US)”

* GT was a top pick for Adidas bc of MSE and Atlanta’s entertainment rep that Adidas' clothing brands cater to -> this will give us unique opportunities.

> “Geography is important and the fact that we are 30 mi from the speed factory” will help us a lot - OSU's proximity to Nike still got them access to pre-release products, even though they weren't Oregon

## Verdict

Stansbury's comments at CREATE-X assure fans that Georgia Tech is firmly invested in sports-tech in its athletics program. GTAA intends to tightly couple technology and the athletics program, wielding a strong partnership with Adidas, the devout interest of Atlanta' professional sports franchises, Atlanta's burgeoning reputation as a technological hub, and support from Tech academia to seek out innovations to make our program more efficient and better at what we do. Considered together, these factors create a huge potential for growth and innovation for athletics heretofore unseen across the nation.

Arguably the most important point Stansbury made during his session focused on the Georgia Tech brand. He touches on a common pain point for the vast majority of Tech fans: why *CAN'T* Tech be like Stanford? Why *CAN'T* we recruit the brightest students *AND* the best athletes to the Flats? Stansbury cites winning as the main ingredient in a successful brand like the Cardinal, and I'm inclined to agree: successful programs produce a self-fulfilling prophecy: program success begets good recruiting classes, which beget more program success.

But Stansbury makes it a point to involve the strengths of the Institute in building a successful program: by making use of Atlanta's startup and tech culture, the high technical aptitude of the Institute's students and alumni, and the Institute's various corporate connections, Stansbury and co. can create a culture of technological innovation and emphasis on resource efficiency within the athletic program. He admits that Tech isn't a top destination right now and because of that, "we can’t be lazy...we have to be smarter about how we do things" - we have to make the most of the resources we have right now. We *have* to rely on number-crunching and analysis to make the best decisions for our program, whether that be in maximizing ticket revenue or recruiting the state's best athletes. We *have* to incorporate new methods and software that help our athletes train better and recover from injury faster. Integrating new technology into our athletics processes is how we help our scrappy teams of 3-star recruits upset squads filled to the brim with vaunted 5-stars. Tech is known as a hub for technological innovation - why not bring that expertise to our athletics program?

Stansbury's technocratic approach is a refreshing take on the winding saga of Georgia Tech athletics. Even with its high academic standards for athletes, Tech has always had the potential to become an athletic powerhouse like Stanford - we're in one of the best and fastest-growing cities in America, we have a top-class academic reputation, and we have a tradition of success in the classroom and industry. Now, with Stansbury at the helm and a renewed emphasis on technology and innovation in the athletics program, we have the opportunity to build a tradition of winning on the Flats.
