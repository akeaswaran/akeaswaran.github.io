title: Hello World!
---
Hello to all that read this! Welcome to my new foray into web development.

### Notes about the Site

This site is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a great resource for building blogs and static pages with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's highly customizable and developer-friendly; in fact, I'm typing this post right now using it!

### Site features

This site utilizes a sliding sidebar built by [Poole's](https://github.com/poole/poole) CSS. This menu provides visitors (like yourself, dear reader) a few navigation options:

* A link back to this home page
* A link to my about page
* A link to my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/akeaswaran)
* And a link to this site's [project on Github](https://github.com/shivadoc/shivadoc.github.io/), where readers can open issues and make their own sites like this.

### Browser support

My site will display correctly on most, if not all, devices and browsers, including mobile and desktop Chrome and Safari, as well as Firefox.

### Future content

In the future, I hope to post here interesting stuff I have learned while developing iOS apps, tutorials on how to create a few iOS app features, and any editorials I deem too long to post on Twitter.


Thanks for reading this initial post, and I hope you return here soon for new, more exciting reads!
