            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div id="introText">
                <p>I'm Akshay Easwaran, and I'm a senior at Milton High School in Milton, Georgia, USA.</p>

                <p>I'm very interested in the field of computer science and hope to major in it when I move on to college in a few years. I've been working with and on computers for most of my life and have developed a geniune fascination with how they work and how the software that controls them works.</p>

                <p>I originally got into iOS programming when my family first bought an iMac. I followed a few basic tutorials from online and was immediately hooked. I eventually bought a MacBook Pro and started developing apps for my family members and school.</p>

                <p>I started an iOS development club at my high school. With help from the club's members, I released both Milton GameDay and Milton ClassConnect for the students at my school</p>

                <p>Last summer, I interned with CloudSherpas, a Salesforce.com partner in Atlanta, and assisted on a iOS development project that worked with the Salesforce iOS SDK and CoreData. Later this year, I hope to intern at a few more companies to gain more experience in the mobile development field.</p>

                <p>This summer, I interned at Salesforce.com in Atlanta, learning about web development and working on large-scale corporate applications.</p>
