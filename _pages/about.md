### <a name="about"></a>About Me
I'm Akshay Easwaran, and I'm a software engineer at Salesforce. I completed my BS in Computer Science (with a minor in Sports, Society, and Technology) at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2019.

I originally got into programming when my family first bought an iMac and suggested I learn how to create iPhone applications. I followed a few basic tutorials from online and was immediately hooked. I eventually bought a MacBook Pro and started developing apps as a hobby, hoping one day to be good enough at programming to turn my skills into a career.

I'm especially interested in the intersection of technology and sport. My hobby computing projects have been centered around integrating sports information and sports data with technical resources to sharpen my skills with data and newer web and native technologies, while much of my remaining spare time is spent immersing myself in the world of sport, both as a fan and an armchair analyst for Georgia Tech sports blog _[From the Rumble Seat](https://fromtherumbleseat.com/)_ (you can view all of my work [here](https://fromtherumbleseat.com/authors/akeaswaran)). I have not only had the chance to build software around sport and using sports knowledge, I’ve also had the opportunity to think critical and objectively about sport, sporting events, sporting history, and sport sociology.

In addition to my work and personal projects, I am an avid Atlanta sports fan and casual Atlanta sports historian. I find the development and evolution of sports in this city — and especially how both have intertwined with the city’s political structures, demographics, and development — an incredibly interesting and rich topic of study.

### <a name="work-experience"></a>Work Experience
In the summer of 2013, I worked at **CloudSherpas, Inc.**, a cloud-computing and mobile application consulting company based in Atlanta, as an intern in the software engineering department. I helped create an iOS application that interacted with the Salesforce backend service for one of the company's clients.

During the summer of 2014, I interned at **AppsNMotion, Inc.**, a mobile application startup based in Atlanta, testing production code of the company’s restaurant discovery and rewards application, as well as writing logic to enhance the user experience and create new features.

From July 2014 to August 2017, I worked at Pardot, a **Salesforce** company based in Atlanta, as a software engineering intern. I helped maintain a large-scale sales and marketing web application to deliver marketing emails to businesses and people. During the summer of 2016, I worked with a scrum team of six other engineers to produce new features that tighten Pardot’s Salesforce CRM integration and played a key role in directing Intern Hack Week, a week-long hackathon for the six Salesforce interns posted in Atlanta, and oversaw the creation of a basic machine-learning project that analyzed analytics data from Pardot to find trends in customer activity behind closed deals. During the summer of 2017, I leveraged Apache Storm and Kafka to build a prototype that streamed Salesforce change events to MySQL.

Between December 2017 and May 2018, I was a DevOps intern in **T-Mobile**'s TechX Internship Program, building Tableau dashboards to visualize project health and Agile metrics and support executive and managerial decision making.

For summer 2018, I returned to **Salesforce** as a software engineering intern with Pardot, this time based out of San Francisco, CA. In this stint, I helped improve Pardot’s Salesforce integration by building Java and PHP features for a version of the Pardot experience accessible from within Salesforce.

In fall 2018, I worked with **The Coca-Cola Company** as an intern with _The Bridge by Coca-Cola_, connecting customer and internal teams with startups to solve their most pressing business challenges.

As of summer 2019, I returned to **Salesforce** with Pardot again, building tools and end-to-end automation systems to maximize the quality of new features on the Salesforce platform.
