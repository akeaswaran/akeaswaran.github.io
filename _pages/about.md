I'm Akshay Easwaran, and I'm a data engineer at the [United States Soccer Federation](https://ussoccer.com/). I completed my BS in Computer Science (with a minor in Sports, Society, and Technology) at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2019, spending the next 3.5 years working on email marketing software and internal tools at [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) and another 1.5 years as a data engineer at [Atlanta United FC](https://atlutd.com).

I'm especially interested in the intersection of technology and sport. My hobby computing projects have been centered around integrating sports information and sports data with technical resources to sharpen my skills with data and newer web and native technologies, while much of my remaining spare time is spent immersing myself in the world of sport, both as a fan and an armchair analyst for Georgia Tech sports blog _[From the Rumble Seat](https://fromtherumbleseat.com/)_ (you can view all of my work [here](https://fromtherumbleseat.com/authors/akeaswaran)). You can view some of my current projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/akeaswaran/).

In addition to my professional and personal projects, I am an avid Atlanta sports fan and casual Atlanta sports historian. I find the development and evolution of sports in this city — and especially how both have intertwined with the city’s political structures, demographics, and development - fascinating to study.
