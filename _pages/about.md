### <a name="about"></a>About Me
I'm Akshay Easwaran, and I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

I fell in love with computer science long ago. I've been working with computers for most of my life and have developed a genuine fascination with how they and their software work.

I originally got into programming when my family first bought an iMac and suggested I learn how to create iPhone applications. I followed a few basic tutorials from online and was immediately hooked. I eventually bought a MacBook Pro and started developing apps as a hobby, hoping one day to be good enough at programming to turn my skills into a career.

### <a name="work-experience"></a>Work Experience
In the summer of 2013, I worked at **CloudSherpas, Inc.**, a cloud-computing and mobile application consulting company based in Atlanta, as an intern in the software engineering department. I helped create an iOS application that interacted with the Salesforce backend service for one of the company's clients.

During the summer of 2014, I interned at **AppsNMotion, Inc.**, a mobile application startup based in Atlanta, testing production code of the company’s restaurant discovery and rewards application, as well as writing logic to enhance the user experience and create new features.

From July 2014 to August 2017, I worked at Pardot, a **Salesforce** company based in Atlanta, as a software engineering intern. I helped maintain a large-scale sales and marketing web application to deliver marketing emails to businesses and people. During the summer of 2016, I worked with a scrum team of six other engineers to produce new features that tighten Pardot’s Salesforce CRM integration and played a key role in directing Intern Hack Week, a week-long hackathon for the six Salesforce interns posted in Atlanta, and oversaw the creation of a basic machine-learning project that analyzed analytics data from Pardot to find trends in customer activity behind closed deals. During the summer of 2017, I leveraged Apache Storm and Kafka to build a prototype that streamed Salesforce change events to MySQL.

Between December 2017 and May 2018, I was a DevOps intern in **T-Mobile**'s TechX Internship Program, building Tableau dashboards to visualize project health and Agile metrics and support executive and managerial decision making.

For summer 2018, I returned to **Salesforce** as a software engineering intern with Pardot, this time based out of San Francisco, CA. In this stint, I helped improve Pardot’s Salesforce integration by building Java and PHP features for a version of the Pardot experience accessible from within Salesforce.

In fall 2018, I worked with **The Coca-Cola Company** as an intern with _The Bridge by Coca-Cola_, connecting customer and internal teams with startups to solve their most pressing business challenges.

In my spare time, I write for Georgia Tech sports blog _[From the Rumble Seat](https://fromtherumbleseat.com/)_. You can view all of my work [here](https://fromtherumbleseat.com/authors/akeaswaran).
