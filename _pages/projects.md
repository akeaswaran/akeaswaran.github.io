All of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/akeaswaran). I mainly work with the Objective-C, Java, and JavaScript programming languages, but have a working knowledge of PHP, Apex, and Visualforce. I have also worked extensively with MySQL, MongoDB, the Salesforce CRM, and the Pardot web application. Some of my notable projects are:

* [Ramblin' Reck history site](https://akeaswaran.me/reck/):
A static website built with Jekyll detailing the storied history of Georgia Tech's beloved mascot car.

* [TEDxGeorgiaTech Ticketing](https://github.com/tedxgeorgiatech/tedxgt-ticketing):
An event-management platform built with NodeJS to help TEDxGeorgiaTech manage and market its events in-house.

* [Football Coach](https://github.com/akeaswaran/FootballCoach-iOS):
A college football simulation game for iOS.

* [CFB Scoreboard API](https://github.com/akeaswaran/cfb-scoreboard-api):
A NodeJS REST API built to reformat ESPN's "hidden" college football JavaScript API data into something more developer-friendly and integrate matchup history from [College Football API](https://collegefootballapi.com/).

* [ReachWeather](https://github.com/akeaswaran/ReachWeather):
A software modification, or "tweak", for jailbroken iOS devices that puts local weather information in the empty screen space above the current app when Reachability is invoked.
