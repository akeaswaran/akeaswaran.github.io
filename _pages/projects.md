All of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/akeaswaran). I mainly work with the Objective-C, Java, and JavaScript programming languages, but have a working knowledge of PHP, Apex, and Visualforce. I have also worked with Python, R, MySQL, the Salesforce CRM, and the Pardot web application. Some of my notable programming projects are:

* [College Football Coach](https://github.com/akeaswaran/FootballCoach-iOS):
A college football simulation game for iOS.

* [Game on Paper](https://gameonpaper.com): A site for advanced college football statistics.

* [Ramblin' Reck website](http://reckclub.org/):
A brand new PHP-based web presence for the Ramblin' Reck Club at Georgia Tech.

* [Ramblin' Reck history site](http://reckclub.org/reckhistory):
A static website built with Jekyll detailing the storied history of Georgia Tech's beloved mascot car.

* [Donovan](https://github.com/akeaswaran/mls-bar): A macOS menubar application written in Objective-C that displays live scores and updates from Major League Soccer matches. Named after US Soccer legend Landon Donovan.

I've also done some basic data analysis work using Python and R, most of which can be found on my GitHub profile: [@akeaswaran](https://github.com/akeaswaran/).
