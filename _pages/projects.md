Most of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/akeaswaran). I've worked primarily with Swift, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript, but I've also had experience building software with R, PHP, and SQL (among others). A few notable projects can be found below.

* [Glass Onion](https://github.com/USSoccerFederation/glass_onion): 
A Python package to make synchronizing soccer object identifiers across data providers easier.

* [Game on Paper](https://gameonpaper.com): A site for advanced college football statistics.

* [College Football Coach](https://akeaswaran.me/cfc-ios):
A college football simulation game for iOS.

* [Ramblin' Reck website](http://reckclub.org/):
A brand new PHP-based web presence for the Ramblin' Reck Club at Georgia Tech.
