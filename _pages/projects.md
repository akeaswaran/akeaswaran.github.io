All of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/akeaswaran). I mainly work with the Objective-C, Java, and JavaScript programming languages, but have a working knowledge of PHP, Apex, and Visualforce. I have also worked extensively with MySQL, MongoDB, the Salesforce CRM, and the Pardot web application. Some of my notable projects are:

* [Ramblin' Reck website](http://reckclub.org/):
A brand new PHP-based web presence for the Ramblin' Reck Club at Georgia Tech.

* [Ramblin' Reck history site](http://reckclub.org/reckhistory):
A static website built with Jekyll detailing the storied history of Georgia Tech's beloved mascot car.

* [College Football Coach](https://github.com/akeaswaran/FootballCoach-iOS):
A college football simulation game for iOS.

* [CFB Scoreboard API](https://github.com/akeaswaran/cfb-scoreboard-api):
A NodeJS REST API built to reformat ESPN's "hidden" college football JavaScript API data into something more developer-friendly and integrate matchup history from [College Football API](https://collegefootballapi.com/).

* [Donovan](https://github.com/akeaswaran/mls-bar): A macOS menubar application written in Objective-C that displays live scores and updates from Major League Soccer matches. Named after US Soccer legend Landon Donovan.
