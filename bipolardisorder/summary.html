        <h4 style="color:white;text-align:center;">Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison's Battle with Bipolar Disorder</h3>
        <i>
          <p style="text-align:left;">In her bestselling classic, An Unquiet Mind, Kay Redfield Jamison changed the way we think about moods and madness.</p>

          <p style="text-align:left;">Dr. Jamison is one of the foremost authorities on manic-depressive (bipolar) illness; she has also experienced it firsthand. For even while she was pursuing her career in academic medicine, Jamison found herself succumbing to the same exhilarating highs and catastrophic depressions that afflicted many of her patients, as her disorder launched her into ruinous spending sprees, episodes of violence, and an attempted suicide.</p>

          <p style="text-align:left;">Here Jamison examines bipolar illness from the dual perspectives of the healer and the healed, revealing both its terrors and the cruel allure that at times prompted her to resist taking medication. An Unquiet Mind is a memoir of enormous candor, vividness, and wisdom—a deeply powerful book that has both transformed and saved lives.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;"><i>"But then as night inevitably goes after the day, my mood would crash and my mind again would grind to a halt. I lost all interest in my schoolwork, friends, reading, wandering or daydreaming. I had no idea of what was happening to me and I would wake up in the morning with a profound sense of dread that I was going to have to somehow make it through another entire day. I would sit for hour after hour in the undergraduate library, unable to muster up enough energy to go to class."</i> (pg. 44)</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;"><i>"No amount of love can cure madness or unblacken one's dark moods. Love can help, it can make the pain more tolerable, but always one it beholden to medication that may or may not always work and may not be bearable. Madness, on the other hand, most certainly can and often does kill love through its mistrustfulness, unrelenting pessimism, discontents, erratic behavior and especially through its savage moods."</i> (pg. 175)</p>
